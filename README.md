# BLEU-Score

Calculates the BLEU evaluation metric

The program will run on sets of candidate and reference translations, and calculate the BLEU score for each candidate.

The German, Greek and Portuguese reference translations above are excerpted from the common test set of the EUROPARL corpus; the candidate translations were obtained by taking the corresponding English sentences and running them through Google Translate. The English reference translations are from two alternative translations of the Passover Hagaddah; the candidate translation was obtained by running the original Hebrew text through Google translate. The actual test will be done with similar files.
